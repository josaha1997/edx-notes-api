# Packages installed:
# git; Used to pull in particular requirements from github rather than pypi, 
# and to check the sha of the code checkout.

# language-pack-en locales; ubuntu locale support so that system utilities have a consistent
# language and time zone.

# python; ubuntu doesnt ship with python, so this is the python we will use to run the application

# python3-pip; install pip to install application requirements.txt files

# libssl-dev; # mysqlclient wont install without this.

# libmysqlclient-dev; to install header files needed to use native C implementation for 
# MySQL-python for performance gains.
# software-properties-common; to get apt-add-repository
# deadsnakes PPA to install Python 3.8
# If you add a package here please include a comment above describing what it is used for
